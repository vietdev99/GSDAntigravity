## Tool Mapping (Claude Code → Antigravity IDE)

When this workflow references Claude Code tools, translate to Antigravity equivalents:

| Claude Code | Antigravity | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Read | view_file | Use view_file_outline for structure |
| Write | write_to_file | Creates/overwrites files |
| Edit | replace_file_content | Use multi_replace_file_content for non-contiguous edits |
| Bash | run_command | Returns command ID, use command_status to monitor |
| Task(subagent_type="X", prompt="Y") | run_command | Spawn subagent via terminal command |
| AskUserQuestion | notify_user | Set BlockedOnUser=true for questions |
| Glob | find_by_name | File search with glob patterns |
| Grep | grep_search | Ripgrep-based search |

## Task() → Terminal Spawning

GSD workflows use `Task(subagent_type="X", prompt="Y")` to spawn subagents.
In Antigravity, spawn agents via terminal using `run_command`:

- Pass the agent prompt and context as arguments
- Use `command_status` to wait for completion
- Collect results from command output

## AskUserQuestion → notify_user

Translate `AskUserQuestion` calls to `notify_user`:
- `header` → included in Message
- `question` → included in Message  
- Set `BlockedOnUser: true` to wait for user response
- Options formatted as numbered list in Message

<objective>
Analyze a phase and present Claude's assumptions about technical approach, implementation order, scope boundaries, risk areas, and dependencies.

Purpose: Help users see what Claude thinks BEFORE planning begins - enabling course correction early when assumptions are wrong.
Output: Conversational output only (no file creation) - ends with "What do you think?" prompt
</objective>

<execution_context>
@./.antigravity/get-shit-done/workflows/list-phase-assumptions.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Phase number: $ARGUMENTS (required)

Project state and roadmap are loaded in-workflow using targeted reads.
</context>

<process>
1. Validate phase number argument (error if missing or invalid)
2. Check if phase exists in roadmap
3. Follow list-phase-assumptions.md workflow:
   - Analyze roadmap description
   - Surface assumptions about: technical approach, implementation order, scope, risks, dependencies
   - Present assumptions clearly
   - Prompt "What do you think?"
4. Gather feedback and offer next steps
</process>

<success_criteria>

- Phase validated against roadmap
- Assumptions surfaced across five areas
- User prompted for feedback
- User knows next steps (discuss context, plan phase, or correct assumptions)
  </success_criteria>
