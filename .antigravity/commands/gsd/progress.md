## Tool Mapping (Claude Code → Antigravity IDE)

When this workflow references Claude Code tools, translate to Antigravity equivalents:

| Claude Code | Antigravity | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Read | view_file | Use view_file_outline for structure |
| Write | write_to_file | Creates/overwrites files |
| Edit | replace_file_content | Use multi_replace_file_content for non-contiguous edits |
| Bash | run_command | Returns command ID, use command_status to monitor |
| Task(subagent_type="X", prompt="Y") | run_command | Spawn subagent via terminal command |
| AskUserQuestion | notify_user | Set BlockedOnUser=true for questions |
| Glob | find_by_name | File search with glob patterns |
| Grep | grep_search | Ripgrep-based search |

## Task() → Terminal Spawning

GSD workflows use `Task(subagent_type="X", prompt="Y")` to spawn subagents.
In Antigravity, spawn agents via terminal using `run_command`:

- Pass the agent prompt and context as arguments
- Use `command_status` to wait for completion
- Collect results from command output

## AskUserQuestion → notify_user

Translate `AskUserQuestion` calls to `notify_user`:
- `header` → included in Message
- `question` → included in Message  
- Set `BlockedOnUser: true` to wait for user response
- Options formatted as numbered list in Message

<objective>
Check project progress, summarize recent work and what's ahead, then intelligently route to the next action - either executing an existing plan or creating the next one.

Provides situational awareness before continuing work.

<process>
Execute the progress workflow from @./.antigravity/get-shit-done/workflows/progress.md end-to-end.
Preserve all routing logic (Routes A through F) and edge case handling.
