## Tool Mapping (Claude Code → Antigravity IDE)

When this workflow references Claude Code tools, translate to Antigravity equivalents:

| Claude Code | Antigravity | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Read | view_file | Use view_file_outline for structure |
| Write | write_to_file | Creates/overwrites files |
| Edit | replace_file_content | Use multi_replace_file_content for non-contiguous edits |
| Bash | run_command | Returns command ID, use command_status to monitor |
| Task(subagent_type="X", prompt="Y") | run_command | Spawn subagent via terminal command |
| AskUserQuestion | notify_user | Set BlockedOnUser=true for questions |
| Glob | find_by_name | File search with glob patterns |
| Grep | grep_search | Ripgrep-based search |

## Task() → Terminal Spawning

GSD workflows use `Task(subagent_type="X", prompt="Y")` to spawn subagents.
In Antigravity, spawn agents via terminal using `run_command`:

- Pass the agent prompt and context as arguments
- Use `command_status` to wait for completion
- Collect results from command output

## AskUserQuestion → notify_user

Translate `AskUserQuestion` calls to `notify_user`:
- `header` → included in Message
- `question` → included in Message  
- Set `BlockedOnUser: true` to wait for user response
- Options formatted as numbered list in Message

<objective>
Validate built features through conversational testing with persistent state.

Purpose: Confirm what Claude built actually works from user's perspective. One test at a time, plain text responses, no interrogation. When issues are found, automatically diagnose, plan fixes, and prepare for execution.

Output: {phase_num}-UAT.md tracking all test results. If issues found: diagnosed gaps, verified fix plans ready for /gsd:execute-phase
</objective>

<execution_context>
@./.antigravity/get-shit-done/workflows/verify-work.md
@./.antigravity/get-shit-done/templates/UAT.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Phase: $ARGUMENTS (optional)
- If provided: Test specific phase (e.g., "4")
- If not provided: Check for active sessions or prompt for phase

Context files are resolved inside the workflow (`init verify-work`) and delegated via `<files_to_read>` blocks.
</context>

<process>
Execute the verify-work workflow from @./.antigravity/get-shit-done/workflows/verify-work.md end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (session management, test presentation, diagnosis, fix planning, routing).
</process>
