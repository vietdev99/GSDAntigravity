## Tool Mapping (Claude Code → Antigravity IDE)

When this workflow references Claude Code tools, translate to Antigravity equivalents:

| Claude Code | Antigravity | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Read | view_file | Use view_file_outline for structure |
| Write | write_to_file | Creates/overwrites files |
| Edit | replace_file_content | Use multi_replace_file_content for non-contiguous edits |
| Bash | run_command | Returns command ID, use command_status to monitor |
| Task(subagent_type="X", prompt="Y") | run_command | Spawn subagent via terminal command |
| AskUserQuestion | notify_user | Set BlockedOnUser=true for questions |
| Glob | find_by_name | File search with glob patterns |
| Grep | grep_search | Ripgrep-based search |

## Task() → Terminal Spawning

GSD workflows use `Task(subagent_type="X", prompt="Y")` to spawn subagents.
In Antigravity, spawn agents via terminal using `run_command`:

- Pass the agent prompt and context as arguments
- Use `command_status` to wait for completion
- Collect results from command output

## AskUserQuestion → notify_user

Translate `AskUserQuestion` calls to `notify_user`:
- `header` → included in Message
- `question` → included in Message  
- Set `BlockedOnUser: true` to wait for user response
- Options formatted as numbered list in Message

<objective>
Create `.continue-here.md` handoff file to preserve complete work state across sessions.

Routes to the pause-work workflow which handles:
- Current phase detection from recent files
- Complete state gathering (position, completed work, remaining work, decisions, blockers)
- Handoff file creation with all context sections
- Git commit as WIP
- Resume instructions
</objective>

<execution_context>
@./.antigravity/get-shit-done/workflows/pause-work.md
</execution_context>

<context>
State and phase progress are gathered in-workflow with targeted reads.
</context>

<process>
**Follow the pause-work workflow** from `@./.antigravity/get-shit-done/workflows/pause-work.md`.

The workflow handles all logic including:
1. Phase directory detection
2. State gathering with user clarifications
3. Handoff file writing with timestamp
4. Git commit
5. Confirmation with resume instructions
</process>
